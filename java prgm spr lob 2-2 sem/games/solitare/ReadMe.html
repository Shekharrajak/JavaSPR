<h1>Solitare Game</h1>
<p>
This 
<a href=".">directory</a>
contains the 
<a href="./solit.ps.gz">compressed postscript</a> (also available in <a href="./solit.pdf" >pdf</a>)
for the chapter describing the solitare application written in Java.
The purpose of this chapter (and program) is to illustrate the power of
inheritance as a technique for software reuse and customization.
<p>
The program was originally written in C++ in the first edition of my
OOP book, and rewritten in Java for the second edition.  The version given
here is a revision of the Java version, now using features of the language
from the 1.1 revision.
<p>
The source consists of three files:
<ul>
<li>The file <a href="Card.java">Card.java</a>, which holds the playing card abstraction.
<li>The file <a href="CardPile.java">CardPile.java</a>, which holds the 
base class for the different card piles.
<li>The file <a href="Solitare.java">Solitare.java</a>, which holds the
subclasses of CardPile, as well as the main application class.
</ul>
<p>
So far, this has only been written as an application.
(An applet version in Java 1.0.2 was 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.orst.edu/pub/budd/oopintro/2ndEdition/solitare">described</a>
in the 2nd edition of the OOP book).
I'm thinking that later I may describe how to write it in either form.
